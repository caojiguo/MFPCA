# Codes for the real data application and simulation studies in the manuscript entitled "Functional Principal Component Analysis for Multiple Variables on Different Riemannian Manifolds". 

The details of each file are

1. FPCA_MVDM_application.R: This R file runs the proposed multivariate FPCA on wind data collected from 3 cities and also evaluate the method by the finite sample performance.

2. winddata.rds: This file contains the wind data from three cities in the time between 1998-2018.
  
3. Simulation_study.R: This R file includes the Simulation Study I.

4. Sparse_simulation_study.R: This file includes the Simulation Study II for each degree of sparsity in the data.

5. sparse_simulation.Rdata: Simulations are done over replications, this Rdata file saves results from executed codes for checking.

6. functions.R: This R file contains functions for running FPCA_MVDM. 

7. sim_functions.R: This R file contains functions for running FPCA_MVDM and those for simulations.
